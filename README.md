## OOP Definitons

### Class Inheritence
Inheritance dictates that a class inherits ALL of the properties and methods from it's base class.

### Abstraction
If a class will never be instantiated; if a class has derived classes so it will never be created, it should be made abstract to keep it from being instantiated.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the property that holds everything within a class.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism means that at run time, a derived class can be instatiated by it's base class. If a method takes in the base class as a parameter, it will accept the derivded class as well.
